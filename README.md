## Project Description

This project is a web-based version of the popular 2048 puzzle game. 
Players combine numbered tiles by sliding them across the grid to reach the 2048 tile. 
The game is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, ensuring smooth animations and responsive design.

## What I learned

#### JavaScript: Improved your ability to manipulate the DOM and handle game logic.
#### CSS Flexbox/Grid: Achieved a responsive layout for various devices.
#### Event Handling: Managed user interactions effectively.
#### Async/Await: Implemented asynchronous operations for smooth animations and transitions.
